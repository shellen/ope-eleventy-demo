# OPE Demo Suite

Working implementations of every layer in the [Open Portable Entitlement (OPE)](https://feedspec.org) architecture: publisher, gateway, and reader. See the full protocol in action with running code.

Aligned with **OPE spec v0.1** (March 2026).

## Why this exists

Specifications are necessary but not sufficient. You can read the OPE spec and understand what discovery endpoints, grant tokens, and content retrieval are supposed to do, but the distance between reading a spec and believing it works is the distance between a diagram and running code. This project exists to close that gap.

When we designed OPE, we made a bet that entitlement could be cleanly separated from payment processing and content distribution. That's an easy claim to make in a specification document. It's a harder claim to prove. So we built the simplest possible versions of all three roles in the protocol: a publisher that serves an Eleventy blog with OPE-enabled feeds, a gateway that issues and manages JWT grant tokens, and a reader that walks through the entire lifecycle from discovery to revocation. You can run all three on your laptop in one command and watch the tokens flow between them.

We deliberately kept each component small enough to read in one sitting. The gateway is a single Express server file. The reader is a single script with zero dependencies. The blog is a standard Eleventy site with a handful of templates. If you want to understand how OPE works, you shouldn't need to deploy infrastructure or study a framework. You should be able to read the code, run the demo, and start building.

## What's in this repo

```
run-demo.sh              ← One-command launcher — installs deps and starts everything
ope-blog/                ← Publisher: Eleventy blog with OPE-enabled feeds + content API
ope-gateway/             ← Gateway:   Express server that issues/refreshes/revokes JWT grants
ope-reader/              ← Reader:    Browser UI + CLI that walks the full OPE lifecycle
eleventy-plugin-ope/     ← Plugin:    Reusable Eleventy plugin for adding OPE to any blog
```

### How OPE works

OPE separates four concerns: content, distribution, entitlement, and payments (spec Section 3). This repo demonstrates the first three. Payments are explicitly out of scope. OPE proves access, it doesn't move money.

1. GET /.well-known/ope        → Discover publisher capabilities (§6)
2. ← Discovery document        (content endpoint, token mode, plans, broker support)
3. GET /feed.json              → Fetch JSON Feed with OPE extensions (§9)
4. ← Feed with gated items     (previews, content_metadata, resource_type, unlock_url)
5. POST /api/entitlement/grant → Request grant + refresh token (§8)
6. ← JWT grant token            (14 grant types: subscription, trial, bundle, ...)
7. GET /api/content/{id}       → Fetch gated content with Bearer token (§10)
8. ← Full content               (articles, podcasts, video — resource-agnostic)
```

## Quick start: one command

```bash
./run-demo.sh
```

This installs all dependencies and starts three services:

| Service | Port | What it is |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Reader UI** | [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Browser-based OPE demo. Click "Run Full Demo" to walk through every step |
| **Publisher** | [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) | Eleventy blog with OPE-enabled feeds and content API |
| **Gateway** | [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) | Express server issuing/refreshing/revoking JWT grants |

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser and click the button. The UI walks through each OPE step visually: discovery, feed parsing, grant acquisition, content fetch, token refresh, and revocation. It shows the actual HTTP requests and responses.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop everything.

### Manual setup (three terminals)

If you prefer to run each component separately:

```bash
export OPE_JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-change-me

# Terminal 1 — Publisher
cd ope-blog && npm install && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Gateway
cd ope-gateway && npm install && npm start

# Terminal 3a — Reader CLI (prints to terminal)
cd ope-reader && node reader.js

# Terminal 3b — Reader Web UI (open http://localhost:3000)
cd ope-reader && npm install && npm run web
```

## Publisher: ope-blog

A complete Eleventy blog with:

- **JSON Feed** (`/feed.json`) with OPE extension blocks including `resource_type`, `unlock_url`, and `per_item_price` (spec §9.1)
- **Discovery endpoint** (`/.well-known/ope`) with `max_ttl_seconds`, `batch_endpoint`, `broker_support` (spec §6)
- **Content API** (Netlify function at `/api/content/{id}`) with spec-aligned error responses (`error`, `error_description`, `ope_discovery`) (spec §10.3)
- **Build-time content store**: gated post content compiled to JSON with `resource_type`
- **Sample posts**: mix of free and gated content with OPE frontmatter

Posts are gated with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
ope_gated: true
ope_content_id: protocol-economics
ope_level: subscriber
ope_resource_type: article
ope_cta: "Subscribe for $5/month to read the full essay"
ope_grants:
  - subscription
  - gift
---
```

See [`ope-blog/README.md`](./ope-blog/README.md) for deployment details.

## Gateway: ope-gateway

A sample Express server implementing the OPE gateway endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Spec section | What it does |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `/api/entitlement/grant` | POST | §8 | Issue a JWT grant token + refresh token |
| `/api/entitlement/refresh` | POST | §12.3 | Refresh with token rotation |
| `/api/entitlement/revoke` | POST | §12.2 | Revoke with reason code |
| `/.well-known/ope` | GET | §6 | Gateway discovery document |

Supports all 14 grant types from the spec (§21): `subscription`, `per_item`, `gift`, `institutional`, `metered`, `locale_free`, `patronage`, `broker`, `trial`, `rental`, `bundle`, `ad_supported`, `early_access`, `family`.

Try it with curl:

```bash
# Get a subscription grant
curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/entitlement/grant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "alice", "grant_type": "subscription"}' | jq

# Use the grant_token to fetch gated content from the publisher
TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/entitlement/grant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "alice", "grant_type": "subscription"}' | jq -r .grant_token)

curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/content/protocol-economics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Try a trial grant
curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/entitlement/grant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "bob", "grant_type": "trial"}' | jq
```

See [`ope-gateway/README.md`](./ope-gateway/README.md) for all options.

## Reader: ope-reader

Two ways to experience the OPE lifecycle:

### Browser UI (`npm run web` or via `./run-demo.sh`)

A single-page web app at **http://localhost:3000** that visually walks through each OPE step. Click "Run Full Demo" and watch each step expand with the actual HTTP requests, responses, and rendered content. You can change the user ID and grant type to experiment.

### CLI (`node reader.js`)

A zero-dependency script (Node 18+) that prints the same flow to the terminal:

```bash
node ope-reader/reader.js
node ope-reader/reader.js --user alice --content protocol-economics
```

Both demonstrate the same 6 steps: Discover (§6) → Browse feed (§9) → Acquire grant (§8) → Fetch content (§10) → Refresh with rotation (§12.3) → Revoke (§12.2).

See [`ope-reader/README.md`](./ope-reader/README.md) for all options.

## Eleventy Plugin: eleventy-plugin-ope

A reusable plugin you can drop into any Eleventy blog. Provides:

- Global `ope` data object for templates
- Filters: `opePreview`, `opeWordCount`, `opeReadTime`, `jsonEscape`
- JWT helpers: `createGrant()`, `verifyGrant()`

```js
// eleventy.config.js
const opePlugin = require("./plugins/eleventy-plugin-ope");

export default function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(opePlugin, {
    siteUrl: "https://yourblog.com",
    publisherName: "Your Blog",
    plans: [
      { id: "monthly", name: "Monthly", currency: "USD", amount: 500 },
    ],
  });
}
```

See [`eleventy-plugin-ope/README.md`](./eleventy-plugin-ope/README.md) for the full API.
